# Deprecated Playbook

This playbook is no longer supported and will be deprecated in the near future.

You can continue to review this source till it is removed. This has been
deprecated because the playbooks project architecture has changed and the
artifacts this generates is no longer compatible with the updated playbook
structure.

Sometime in the future, a revision will be introduced to aid in generating
artifacts, till then, please review the installation guides, most playbook
projects require only 4 variables be configure.
