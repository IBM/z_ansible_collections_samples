###############################################################################
# Description:
#  This playbook is used to locate required dependencies (Python, ZOAU) and
#  build a suitable host configuration using the discovered dependencies.
#
#  This playbook generates a host configuration only for Python and
#  ZOAU version >= v1.0.3 dependencies.
#
#  All potential Python and ZOAU installations are output by the playbook
#  in case the Python or ZOAU installation desired by the user is different
#  than the one selected by this playbook.
#
# Usage:
#  ansible-playbook -i <inventory> <playbook>
#   or
#  ansible-playbook -i "hostaddress," <playbook>
#
# Example:
#  ansible-playbook -i inventory host_setup.yaml
#   or
#  ansible-playbook -i "mysystem.to.connect.com," host_setup.yaml
#
# If the user that connects to the host is different from the user submitting
# the playbook, you can optionally instruct the playbook to user another user
# with option '-u <username>' for example:
# ansible-playbook -i "mysystem.to.connect.com," host_setup.yaml -u myHostUser
#
# Notes:
#  This playbook will attempt to locate Ansible dependencies on a z/OS system
#  and use them to generate a valid inventory and host_vars file for the host.
#
#  On a native LPAR, the playbook takes about 1-5 minutes to run, or about
#  5-15 minutes on a z/VM depending on the value of max_search_depth.
#  Execution time may vary depending on the number of files in the
#  Unix System Services filesystem.
#
#  The generated inventory and host_vars files will match the name of the host
#  targeted by this playbook. Backups will be made if there are naming conflicts.
#
#  All potential Python and ZOAU installations are output by the playbook
#  in case the Python or ZOAU installation desired by the user is different
#  than the one selected by this playbook.
#
# Playbook flow:
#  - Search the Unix System Services filesystem for Python and ZOAU binaries with
#    execute bit set. Capture the output as list of potential dependency paths.
#  - Filter and sort discovered python installations by "best" candidates.
#    IBM Python is the first choice, followed by IZODA and Rocket Python in that order.
#  - In a loop, iterating over each Python installation, build a temporary environment
#    variable configuration and attempt to run the ping module. When a Python installation
#    is found that can run the ping module successfully, save this as our chosen Python
#    and skip checking the remaining Python installations.
#  - Retrieve version information for all potential ZOAU installations.
#  - Filter and sort discovered ZOAU installations prioritizing most recent build.
#  - In a loop, iterating over each ZOAU installation, build a temporary environment
#    variable configuration, including the information for the chosen Python installation,
#    and attempt to run the zos_data_set module. When a ZOAU installation is found that can
#    run the zos_data_set module successfully, save this as our chosen ZOAU and skip checking
#    the remaining ZOAU installations.
#  - Create host_vars directory in same directory as playbook if it does not already exist.
#  - Create a new host_vars variable file for the host targeted by this playbook, backing up
#    existing variable files if there are naming conflicts.
#  - Create a new inventory file for the host targeted by this playbook, backing up
#    existing inventory files if there are naming conflicts.
#
# Requirements:
#   IBM z/OS core collection 1.2.0 or later
#
# Optional:
#   minimum_zoau_version - this is the minumum ZOAU release version to consider
#                 when searching for valid ZOAU installations.
#   max_search_depth - this is the maximum directory depth to search when attempting
#                 to locate dependency installations. A large max_search_depth has
#                 a better chance of finding dependency installations. However,
#                 a small max_search_depth will be much faster.
