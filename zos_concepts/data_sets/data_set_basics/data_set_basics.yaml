# This sample playbook demonstrates basic data set operations using modules
# included in the Red Hat Ansible Certified  Content for IBM Z core collection.
#
# Usage:
#  ansible-playbook -i <inventory> <playbook>
#
# Example:
#  ansible-playbook -i inventory data_set_basics.yaml
#
# Notes:
#  This sample demonstrates ways to create, delete and modify data sets using
#  Ansible z/OS core modules. Each module has options available on how
#  automation can be controlled. This sample does not demonstrate all options,
#  refer to documentation or ansible-doc for those options.
#
#  When running this playbook, review the comments on how ths sample will
#  interact with your target, ensure you have the required authority and
#  permissions such as writing the the target directories or creating data sets.
#
#  Data sets created for this sample will follow this pattern
#  <USER>.SOME.DATA.SET where USER will be the user who submits the playbook.
#  The user is identified by the Ansible variable `ansible_user`.
#
#  Additional facts for this playbook can be configured to override the defaults
#  by reviewing the "Fact setting" section of this playbook, for example,
#  `data_set_name` and `system_name`.
#
# Requirements:
#   IBM z/OS core collection 1.1.0 or later
#
# Configure:
#   tgt_tmp_dir - this is the USS directory on the target which will be written
#                 to for this example.
#   ctl_tmp_dir - this is the directory on the controller which will be written
#                 to for this example.
# Optional:
#   data_set_name - this is the data set name that will be created during
#                   execution of this sample.
#   pds_name - this is the pds name that will be used during execution of this
#              sample.
#   system_name - this is the system name that will be used during this example,
#                 determined by executing `uname -n` on the target.
