# Apply ptf using Using Ansible

This project provides sample playbooks and roles which can be used to perform SMPE operations.

It is a good practice to review the playbook sample contents before executing
them. It will help you understand the requirements in terms of space, location,
names, authority, and the artifacts that will be created and cleaned up.
Although samples are written to operate without the need for the user’s
configuration, flexibility is written into the samples because it is not easy
to determine if a sample has access to the host’s resources. Review the
playbook notes sections for additional details and configuration.

  information from the managed z/OS host.
  - Review [inventory documentation](../../docs/share/zos_core/configure_inventory.md)
- Configure the included **host_vars** [zos_host.yml](inventories/host_vars/zos_host.yml)
  with the information from your z/OS system.
  - Review [host_vars documentation](../../docs/share/zos_core/configure_host_vars.md)
    and any additional noted variables in the configuration.

##Run the playbook



This project has included a `site.yml` playbook that serves as the master playbook
that provides additional prerequisite checks.

If you want to run the master playbook `site.yml` it will check that your environment
has the correct version of Ansible as well as the collection needed to execute
correctly. To run the master playbook, use command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories site.yml
```

You can skip the prerequisite check and run the appropriate playbook with
command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventories <playbook-name>
```
