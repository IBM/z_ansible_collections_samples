# Manage z/OS Certificates

This playbook demonstrates how to copy data to and from a z/OS system using modules included in the Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z core collection.

This project contains playbooks and roles that demonstrates certificate renewal
using RACF. The playbooks in this project are designed to address an end to end
scenario managing z/OS certificates beginning with monitoring certificates using
Health Checker, creating an authority and certificates, deleting certificates
and even renewing them.

Although this is an end to end scenario, you can choose to run the individual
playbooks if you are interested in one particular operation. Review the individual
playbook for more details.

These playbook use:

    collection:
        ibm.ibm_zos_core
    modules:
        zos_tso_command
        zos_operator
        zos_job_submit

It is a good practice to review the playbook contents before executing them.
It will help you understand the requirements in terms of space, location, names,
authority, and the artifacts that will be created and cleaned up.
