# Collect z/OS Topology, Software instances and their missing fixes 

These sample playbooks when used with IBM z/OS Management Facility (zOSMF), IBM Z Software Asset Management (IZSAM), IBM Concert, and Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) can simplify the monitoring and resolution of z/OS Software maintenance planning and execution.

It is a good practice to review the playbook contents before executing them.
It will help you understand the requirements in terms of space, location, names,
authority, and the artifacts that will be created and cleaned up.
