# Collect z/OS Software instances Topology, Usage, and missing fixes 

These sample playbooks when used with IBM z/OS Management Facility (zOSMF), IBM Z Software Asset Management (IZSAM), IBM Concert, and Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) can simplify the monitoring and resolution of z/OS Software maintenance, planning, and deployment.

It is a good practice to review the playbook contents before executing them.
It will help you understand the requirements in terms of space, location, names,
authority, and the artifacts that will be created and cleaned up.

## z/OS Target Requirements:
- z/OS v2.5 or later
- z/OS Management Facility v2.5 or later
- IBM Z Software Asset Management v8.2 or later
- Python v3.11
- ZOAU 1.3.0

## Playbook Requirements
These playbooks use:

    collections:
      - name: ibm.ibm_zos_core
        version: 1.10.0

## Tasks Summary
- [**build_swi_collated**](build_swi_collated.yml) - Retrieve z/OS topology of software instances and their missing updates and CSI dataset information from zOSMF
- [**process_count**](process_count.yml) - Aggregate applied critical fixes for each FMID

## Set up job templates on Ansible Automation Platform
These playbooks are designed to be used with Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) job templates. The information in the `host_vars` can be used to set up Inventory and Hosts on AAP.

Here are the set up steps:
- Build an [Execution Environment](execution-environments) using the sample files provided 

- Set up an AAP [job template](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html#create-a-job-template) to send data to Concert. 
- Set up template survey for the following playbook variables:
  ```
  zmf_host: ''
  zmf_port: ''
  zmf_user: ''
  zmf_password: ''
  izsam_jcl: ''
  izsam_csv_dsn: ''
  concert_url: ''
  concert_port: ''
  concert_api_token: ''
  concert_instance_id: ''
  ```
- Set up an AAP [schedule](https://docs.ansible.com/automation-controller/latest/html/userguide/scheduling.html) to send cert data to IBM Concert on a regular basis
