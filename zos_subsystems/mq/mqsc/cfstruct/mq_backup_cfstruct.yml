  # MQ coupling facility backups are asynchronous, so even though the backup command can succeed the backup
  # itself can fail. This playbook attempts to detect a failed backup by getting the current backup time (BKUPTIME) for
  # the structure before performing the backup and comparing it to the backup time after the command has been run.
  # Because of the asynchrounous nature of the backup the playbook pauses to allow time for the backup  to occur.
