dfsdf_changes
=========

Creates a backup of the `DFSDFxxx` member and makes necessary changes to `<SECTION=CATALOG>`. The playbook contains two sections: changes **before** running the populate utility and changes **after** running the populate utility. 

Before running the populate utility:
  - Since IMS catalog is a pre-requisite for managed ACBs, this playbook checks for the resources in the following modules that are necessary for IMS catalog to run:
    - `DFSCD000`
    - `DFSCP000` 
    - `DFSCP001`
    - `DFSCX000`
    - `DFSCPL00`
  - This playbook also ensures the `ACBMGMT` variable is set to `ACBLIB`.

After running the populate utility:
  - This playbook changes the `ACBMGMT` variable to `CATALOG` to enable managed ACBs.
