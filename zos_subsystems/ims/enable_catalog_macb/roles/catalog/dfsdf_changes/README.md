dfsdf_changes
=========

Creates a backup of the `DFSDFxxx` member and makes necessary changes to `<SECTION=CATALOG>`. 

The playbook contains two sections: changes **before** running the populate utility and changes **after** running the populate utility. 
- Before running the populate utility, if the CATALOG section does not exist in the `DFSDFxxx` member, it will be created. The `CATALOG` attribute is set to `N`. 
- After running the populate utitity, the `CATALOG` attribute is changed to `Y` to enable the IMS catalog.
