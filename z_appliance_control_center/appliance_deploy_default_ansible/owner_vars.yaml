# SSA Image Installation Configuration
#
# This section defines the parameters needed to install an SSA (Secure Service
# Appliance) image onto the target IBM Z environment.
#
# The SSA image file is deployed from the control node (e.g., a
# management workstation or laptop) to the designated appliance LPAR.
#
# The parameters below define:
#   - The location of the image file
#   - The minimum cores and memory resources required for installation
#   - The type of image being installed (image or fix)
# min_ifls
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The minimum number of IFLs (Integrated Facility for Linux) required by
# the SSA appliance to run successfully.
#
# Since SSA runs as a Linux-based appliance on IBM Z, at least **1 IFL**
# is required. For better performance, more can be assigned depending on
# the expected workload.
#
# Guidance:
#   - Minimum: 1 IFL (required for installation)
#   - Recommended: 2–4 IFLs for production or performance testing
# min_memory
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The minimum memory (in MB) required by the SSA appliance.
# This is the least amount of memory needed to install and boot the image.
#
# Memory should always be a multiple of 1024 (1 GB).

# Image Installation Parameters

# This section controls how an appliance image, managed by ACC (like SSA, Spyre Support Appliance), 
# is deployed and configured on the target LPAR.
#
# The parameters define whether to perform a new installation or reuse an
# existing image, as well as the cores and memory resources to assign to
# the appliance during startup.
# Defines the hostname that will be assigned to the SSA image after installation.
