# How to use this execution action for installation in standalone mode
#
# You can install lpar with 2 types of execution action with standalone mode:
#   1️. appliance_only → when execution action is **appliance_only** lpar should be in 'installer' mode in HMC 
#                        and must include install parameter in task (18 - As owner, install and activate the image).
#   2️. switch_to_installer   → when execution action is **switch_to_installer** LPAR should be in 'appliance' mode for activation in HMC
#                              and comment install parameter in task (18 - As owner, install and activate the image)
