# Ansible Z Playbook Repository
This repository provides playbooks that can be tailored to automate often
repeated IBM Z tasks, links to blogs, and other related media.

An [Ansible® playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html#playbooks-intro)
consists of organized instructions that define work for a managed node to be
automated with Ansible. The playbooks in this
repository are written using the collections from
**Red Hat® Ansible® Certified Content for IBM Z®** offering. For a detailed
overview of the playbooks, refer to the
[documentation](https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/index.html).

The collections can be found on
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?deprecated=false&keywords=ibm_z&order_by=-relevance&page=1)
and [Automation Hub](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub).
For additional content, review our [community page](http://ibm.biz/BdfsTR).

This repository is frequently updated to refresh content. We recommend that you clone the
the repository and configure your GitHub
[notifications and subscriptions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications#notifications-and-subscriptions)
to receive ongoing updates about specific activity on GitHub.

## Contribute Ansible Playbooks
We are accepting Ansible playbooks from the community. These playbooks
should relate to **IBM Z**, and should either leverage the
**Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** collections, or highlight
additional capabilities and use-cases for **Z automation**. Check out the
[contribution guidelines](docs/share/contribution-guidelines.md) for more
information.

## How playbooks are organized in this repository
All playbooks in this repository can run independently from any other playbook.
Each playbook in this repository includes a README with a brief description,
licensing and instructions on how to configure the playbook. If configuration is
required, a default configuration will be included with the playbook.

## Support
This project is supported by the community though
[Git issues](https://github.com/IBM/z_ansible_collections_samples/issues).

The repository admins and content owners will engage directly with users on
issues reported.

Playbooks are contributed by IBM and the broader Ansible Z community. Therefore,
it may be helpful to review who contributed a playbook as well as its
requirements before opening a Git issue. You can view who the contributor was by
looking at the playbooks commit history as well as notes in the playbook.
